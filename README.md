💼 **What I Bring**: Deep infrastructure expertise combined with a developer-experience mindset. I build platforms that reduce cognitive load and help teams ship faster.

🔐 **Security Posture**: All repositories include Dependabot, secret scanning, pre-commit hooks, and security-focused CI/CD.

📚 **Philosophy**: Infrastructure should be boring in the best way — reliable, predictable, and self-healing.
