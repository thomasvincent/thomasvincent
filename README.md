# Hi, I'm Thomas

I build and fix infrastructure for a living. Mostly working with Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS these days. I like automating things that shouldn't require human intervention and making systems that don't wake people up at 3am.

I use AI tools the way I use any good tool — to sharpen work I've already done. I write my own code, iterate on it in my home lab until it works, and then use AI to review and polish before I put it out in the world. The thinking and architecture are mine; AI helps me catch what I'd miss on a solo project where there's nobody else to keep me honest.

## What I'm tinkering with lately

I've been exploring GitOps patterns with ArgoCD and building out some SSM automation for AWS patching workflows. Also working through Kubernetes certifications and learning more about FinOps — turns out optimizing cloud spend at scale is actually pretty interesting.

On the side, I maintain a few Terraform modules and some tooling around Cloudflare maintenance modes. Built a little progressive web app for tracking genealogy contributions to WikiTree, which started as a weekend project and turned into something I actually use daily.

## Things I've built that I'm proud of

**GitOps Infrastructure Demo** — A reference setup showing how I think about production GitOps with ArgoCD and Terraform. It's what I wish existed when I was learning this stuff.

**Terraform Cloudflare Maintenance Module** — Automates maintenance page handling with real-time analytics. Scratched my own itch after doing this manually too many times.

**Notes MCP Server** — Local interface that makes Apple Notes accessible to AI tools. Simple idea, surprisingly useful.

**WikiTree Dashboard** — Visualizes genealogy contributions and streaks. Turns out gamification works on me.

## Outside of code

I'm a dad and pretty involved in animal rescue. We've got a few rescue dogs and I help out with a local organization when I can. When I'm not at a keyboard, I'm probably reading history or working on family tree research.

I've been doing this infrastructure work for a long time — started in the datacenter era, lived through the cloud migration waves, now deep in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Still learning new things every week, which is the part I like most about this field.
